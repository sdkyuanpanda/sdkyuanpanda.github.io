            <h2>SuperDiff</h2>

            <p>In this project, I applied diffusion models — a type of generative AI model that is behind popular image generators such as Dall-E 2 and Stable Diffusion — for superconductor discovery. In particular, this work focused on applying conditional diffusion models (with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02938" target="_blank" class="inline-link">ILVR</a>) to computationally discovery potential <i>new families</i> of superconductors for the first time. In the past, computational approaches to superconductor discovery could only generate new superconductors from known families and were unable to generate any new families — this work resolves that limitation.</p>

                class="centered-image">       


            <p>Beyond generating new families of hypothetical superconductors for the first time, this model also enables researchers to extrapolate a family of potential superconductors from any single new one they discovery. The model is a powerful tool for accelerating superconductor discovery. I conducted this research with Prof. Dordevic (UAkron), who kindly accepted to mentor me on this project after I cold-emailed him.</p>

            <h2>Firebreak Placement Optimization</h2>

            <p>Together with my friend Armaan Gomes, I worked on a science fair project on firebreak placement optimization with genetic algorithms in sophomore year of high school. In this work, we built a cellular-automata based wildfire simulation with the Alexandridis model that was integrated with real-world data. And, with this, we applied genetic algorithms to compute realistic and effective firebreak constructions.</p>

                style="width: 50%;"
            >

            <p>While a prototype model, our work presents a possible new method for efficient and effective firebreak construction strategy conceptualization — and further development, such as with the integration of additional data, may produce a truly useful real-time assistive tool for wildfire-fighting efforts. The code for this work is publicly assessible and can be found <a href="https://github.com/arghunter/FlamProtect" target="_blank" class="inline-link">here</a>.</p>
